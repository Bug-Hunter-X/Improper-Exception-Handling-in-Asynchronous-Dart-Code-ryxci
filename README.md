# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and provides a solution.

The `bug.dart` file shows a function that fetches data from an API. It uses a `try-catch` block to handle exceptions. However, the error handling is insufficient.

The `bugSolution.dart` file presents improved error handling, providing more context and allowing for better recovery from failures.
